//The trim() method removes whitespace from both sides of a string

let text1 = "      Hello World!      ";
console.log(text1.trim())

//The trimStart() method works like trim(), but removes whitespace only from the start of a string.
let text2 = "     Hello World!     ";
console.log(text2.trimStart())

//The trimEnd() method works like trim(), but removes whitespace only from the end of a string.
let text3 = "     Hello World!     ";
console.log(text3.trimEnd())
